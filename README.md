# Event_Tracker
An iOS app that streamlines event management and reminders, ensuring users stay organized and never miss important occasions.

## Description
The aim of the project is to create an intuitive and user-friendly Event-Planner iOS application that simplifies the process of planning and coordinating events, encouraging meaningful and
well-organized celebrations.

## Methodology
The app methodology encompasses employing the Model-View-Controller pattern, adhering to software engineering principles.
1) Model
   - Manages data and business logic related to events.
   - Communicates updates to the Controller when data changes.
2) View
   - Displays information to the user about events.
   - Sends user input to the Controller to initiate actions.
3) Controller
   - Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
   - Listens for user input from the View and updates the Model accordingly.
   - Updates the View based on changes in the Model.
